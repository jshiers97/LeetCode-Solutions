# LeetCode-Solutions
Collection of LeetCode questions! - Created using [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub)


All of my leetcode solutions get pushed here. If you want to test any of my solutions, you'll need to go to the corresponding Leetcode question and paste my Solution class. Leetcode hides all of their testcases :( 

NOTE: Currently, the browser extension I am using to automatically push my Leetcode solutions to this repo is prepending a 0 to problem number. Keep this in mind when attempting to search for the appropriate problem on the Leetcode website.
